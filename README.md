# Jason Olsen's Professional Portfolio

The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet aesthetically pleasing design for my professional portfolio in order to highlight what I've learned through the bootcamp at UCSD and the internship at Bounteous. The site is a single-page, mobile-responsive application that utilizes HTML, SCSS, ReactJS, SwiperJS, EmailJS and React Icons.
